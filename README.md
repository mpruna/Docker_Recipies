### Docker recipes

### What is Docker:

In this `Github Repo` we will cover some of the most important aspects of using and understanding docker.

Docker is a container based operating-system-level virtualization.
Within Docker applications are built on containers based on specific images.
Each application and its dependencies use a partitioned segment of the operating systemâ€™s resources. The container runtime (Docker, most often) sets up and tears down the containers by drawing on the low-level container services provided by the host operating system.

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package.

### Who is Docker for?
Docker is a tool that is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators, making it a part of many DevOps (developers + operations) toolchains.

### Docker Hub:

Docker images are typically hosted on [Docker_Hub](https://hub.docker.com/)
